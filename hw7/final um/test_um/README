A special thank you to the TAs for help. Shout out to Tina.

The routine that takes the most time is the data structure built with Hanson's
Seq_T struct. This can be improved upon by replacing the Seq_T data structures 
with c-arrays. Besides this factor, the code does not contain any more notable 
areas that can be optimized.

I spent 5 hours analyzing the problems posed in the assignment 
and 40 hours solving the problems after my analysis.
